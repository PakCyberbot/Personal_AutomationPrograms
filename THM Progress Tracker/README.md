# TryHackMe Progress Tracker

If you want to track someone's progress on TryHackMe, particularly which rooms they are completing, you can use this tool. For example, if you are running a giveaway and want to ensure that someone is using it properly, you can first run this tool on the person's profile. You can then monitor their progress daily by setting this script to run in the task scheduler or check it at the end of the voucher period to see which rooms have been completed.
